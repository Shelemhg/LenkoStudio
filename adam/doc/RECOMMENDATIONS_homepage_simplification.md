# Recommendations for Homepage Simplification

This document tracks simplification changes for `adam/index.html` aimed at TikTok creators with minimal attention span.

Goal: switch from long-form reading to a fast, scannable flow: **Hook → Proof → Next Step** (with optional depth below).

---

## Status (Already Applied)

These are already removed from the homepage:

1. ✅ Removed "How It Works" section (`#how-it-works`)
	- Reason: redundant to the Services animations.

2. ✅ Removed "Pricing Snapshot" section (`#pricing-snapshot`)
	- Reason: pricing adds friction when CTA is "Join Free Beta".

3. ✅ Removed "Not a Dashboard. A Growth System." section (`#features`)
	- Reason: it’s a reading-heavy repeat of what the Services visuals already communicate.

---

## Remaining Recommended Deletions (Optional)

If the objective is **maximum simplicity / minimum decisions**, these are still worth removing:

1. Remove "Challenge Selector" (`#challenge-selector`)
	- Reason: adds an extra choice + interaction before belief; the Services section already addresses the 3 problems.
	- Replacement: one short “This is for you if…” line under Services.

2. Remove "Feature Teaser" (`#features-teaser`)
	- Reason: it repeats the same promises already shown via Services + Velocity demo.
	- Replacement: keep one link (“See all features →”) near the footer for deep readers.

## Final Homepage Structure (After Simplification)

This is the recommended section order and the *exact kind of text* each should contain.

### 1) Hero (Above the Fold)

**Keep:** headline, subheadline, one primary CTA, trust line, stats bar, dashboard visual.

**Recommended copy (tighten):**
- Headline: `Stop Guessing. Start Growing.`
- Subheadline: `ADAM turns your TikTok analytics into a daily plan: what to post, what to fix, and what to test.`
- Primary CTA: `Join Free Beta`
- Secondary CTA (optional): `Watch Demo (60s)`
- Trust line: `Read-only • Official TikTok API • You stay in control`

### 2) Services (The Core “What You Get”)

**Keep:** your 3 accordion cards + animations.

**Recommended micro-copy edits (shorter, outcome-first):**
- Card 1 title: `Decode Your Viral DNA`
  - Blurb: `See which hooks, formats, and patterns drive YOUR views — instantly.`
- Card 2 title: `Stay Consistent (Without Burnout)`
  - Blurb: `Daily missions that build momentum and keep you posting.`
- Card 3 title: `Turn Luck Into Science`
  - Blurb: `Run simple experiments and prove what works — then repeat it.`

**Add one line under the section title (optional):**
`Built for creators who want results, not more charts.`

### 3) Trust Bar (Fast Credibility)

**Keep**, but consider reducing to 3 items (optional):
- Official TikTok API
- Secure read-only access
- Real-time data

### 4) Velocity Demo (Proof / “Why This Matters”)

**Keep:** it’s the strongest “mechanism proof” section.

**Recommended copy tighten:**
- Title: `The First Hour Decides Everything`
- Subtitle: `ADAM alerts you early so you can act before the algorithm moves on.`
- Remove/shorten the long italic note (optional) or move it into a tooltip.

### 5) Growth Predictor (Interactive Hook)

**Keep** as an optional/interactive section.

**Recommended copy tighten:**
- Title: `Your 90-Day Growth Forecast`
- Subtitle: `2 questions → instant projection.`

### 6) Testimonials (Belief)

**Keep**, but shorten the amount shown above the fold:
- Show 3–4 unique testimonials max (the “duplicate set for infinite scroll” can stay for animation, but reduce unique messages if desired).

### 7) FAQ (Objection Handling)

**Keep**, but limit to **3–5 questions** and make them blunt:
- Is this safe?
- How does ADAM know what to recommend?
- How fast can I see results?
- Does it work for my niche?
- What do I need to do each day?

### 8) Final CTA (Close)

**Keep:** one clear CTA + 1-line reassurance.

Recommended copy:
- CTA: `Join Free Beta`
- Reassurance: `Read-only access. Cancel anytime. No spam.`

## Summary of Impact

- Removes redundant reading-heavy sections (especially “feature list” style blocks).
- Keeps the strongest attention-holders: animations, interactive proof, and testimonials.
- Makes the page answer quickly: **What is it? Why believe it? What do I do next?**
