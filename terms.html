      <section aria-labelledby="t-who">
        <h2 id="t-who">Who We Are & What This Service Does</h2>
        <p>ADAM is a Lenko Studio service that ingests TikTok profile/video data (via your consented OAuth connection or public pages where permitted), computes text/audio/vision features, and produces analytics and experiment suggestions on <strong>non‑sensitive</strong> variables (e.g., captions, CTAs, timing, editing cadence). In <strong>Research Mode</strong>, we may compute suggestiveness/sensitive metrics for correlation analysis only on adult‑only datasets; we do not generate prescriptive recommendations based on those metrics.</p>
