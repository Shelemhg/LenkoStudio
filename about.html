      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <section aria-labelledby="our-story">
        <h2 id="our-story">Our Story</h2>
        <p><strong>Lenko Studio, a distinct style.</strong> From the busy streets of Manhattan to Upstate New York, Lenko Studio began with a different concept. We later moved to Mexico and evolved, offering a service shaped by the style and experiences of the world’s capital. Deep emotions, rich colors, and naturally elegant posing are the signature of our work.</p>
        <p><strong>Lenko Studio Weddings.</strong> Every service is built on a close, attentive relationship with our clients to ensure expectations are exceeded. We preserve one of life’s most important moments in a relaxed and natural way—telling your story from beginning to end while we capture the highlights and the small, meaningful details of your day. These memories are crafted to be treasures for a lifetime.</p>
