      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Effective date: October 12, 2025</p>

      <section aria-labelledby="p-scope">
        <h2 id="p-scope">Scope</h2>
        <p>This Policy explains how Lenko Studio ("Lenko", "we", "us") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our websites, dashboards, APIs, and related services, including the Orana creator insights (the "Service"). It applies to creators, agencies, and testers who use Orana and Lenko properties.</p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="p-collect">
        <h2 id="p-collect">Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>Information you provide</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Account details (name, email, password or SSO identifier).</li>
          <li>Profile settings, organization/agency name.</li>
          <li>Support messages and feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Data from TikTok (with your consent) or public pages</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>From OAuth/official endpoints (when you authorize): account profile metadata, list of videos, and per‑video metrics (e.g., views, likes, comments, shares). We receive access/refresh tokens and store them securely.</li>
          <li>From public pages (where permitted): publicly visible profile/video data and metrics.</li>
          <li>Derived features: text/audio/vision features computed from your public videos (e.g., caption length, hashtag count, cuts per 15s, color contrast index). In Research Mode, we may compute sensitive/suggestiveness metrics for correlation analysis only on adult‑only datasets. We discard processed frames and store only derived features.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Technical & usage data</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Device/browser information, IP address (truncated or full as configured), timestamps, pages/actions, and error logs.</li>
          <li>Cookies/local storage for session management and analytics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="muted">We do not intentionally collect government IDs, precise geolocation, payment card numbers (unless you subscribe later through a PCI‑compliant processor), or data about minors. If we learn we processed data from a minor, we will delete it.</p>
